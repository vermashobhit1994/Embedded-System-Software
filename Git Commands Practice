1. How to commit source code to specific branch of remote repository from specific commit of local repository 
    Step1: configure user name and user email
           git config --global user.email "user_email"
           git config --global user.name  "user_name"
           where user_email is email id used while creating account on git.
           where user_name is name of account shown in git account.
    Step2: Check whether above details are configured or not 
            git config --list
    Step3: Add the files that you want to add to remote repository
            git add files_name
            where files_name either contains folders or files
    Step4: check what files has been added to staging area. 
             git status 
             where files in green color shows the files that have been added.
    Step5:  commit the files to add to .git local repository
              git commit -m "message"
              where message is message that we want to add while commiting files
    Step6: check the commit files 
             git log --oneline --decorate
              where oneline shows 7character of SHA-ID and decorate shows HEAD and branch to specific commit.
    Step7: Checkout remote branch i.e. pointing HEAD to remote branch 
              Step7-1: Add the remote branch url with specific name that is to be used while accessing url of remote branch
                        git remote add localRemoteRepo remote_url
                         where localRemoteRepo is name used to access remote repository url
                                remote_url is name of remote repository url
              Step7-2: check whether remote repo name is been added or not 
                          git remote -v
              Step7-3: checkout remote branch into new branch in local repository
                         git checkout -b newbranch localRemoteRepo/remoteBranch
                          where newbranch is branch name that we want to create in local repository that contains contents of remote branch.
                                 localRemoteRepo is name of repo used to access remote url
                                 remoteBranch is name of remote branch from which we want to access contents.
   Step8: add commit (contents) from local branch to remote branch
            Step8-1: checkout branch that contains SHAID
                      git checkout master
                        where master is branch name
             Step8-2: Get SHAID that we want to add
                       git log --online
                        Here copy 7 character SHAID that contains contens that we want to add
             Step8-3: checkout to branch that we've created in Step7
                       git checkout newbranch
             Step8-4: add commit into newbranch 
                        git cherry-pick commidId
                         where commitId is SHAID used while commiting files 
              Step8-5: check if commit is added to current branch or not 
                           git log --oneline
   Step9:  Upload data from local repository branch to remote repository branch
            git push localRemoteRepo localBranch:RemoteBranch
                 where localRemoteRepo is name used to access remote url
                        localBranch is name of local branch from where contents are to be transferred to remote repository
                        RemoteBranch is name of remote branch to where contents are to be transferred.
                        
                         
              Step7-4:
