1. Flexibility in time 
   I can be able to work as per my time but not just dedicated 8 hours
   and deliever work
   as per time that I've provided which is done by 
   first understanding given work and then provide the time 
   required for completion of it .
      

2. Saturday and Sunday will be my time. 
   If at some weekends work comes then I can do that but 
   not every weekends.

3. Whenever there is an emergency from my home then 
   I can go at any time.

4. No extra pressure to deliever work in less time.
   Here I increase my output as per my speed and not just
   what other person said.

5. support from other team members or from my team leader or
   manager when I stuck to problem.
   Here by meaning of support, I means that guideline for 
   starting of something where I'm stuck how to begin something
   and rest of it is taken care by me.
   this is to be done for complex things.


6. wanted to work with people where other person 
   encourage me if I'm not able to do any work or found out 
   difficult and not just criticize me.
   but if I done something wrong then other person first tell 
   that what I've done right and then tell me what needs to be corrected.


7. Silent place where I can work alone.
